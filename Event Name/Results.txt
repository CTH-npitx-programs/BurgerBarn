This is where the results shall go:

Firstly, the intermediar:
It worked. The first event destroyed the old refferences, and the second step was basically the same as if I had moved the code into the new event, even though technically I edited the name of the old event and deleted the new one completly.
No excess code was left behind, nor was any (noticible) harm done to the refferences

secondly, the rename:
It also worked, changeing all refferences, and no noticible harm. The "diff" between the 2 methods was none, the resultant files where identical.


So, the second method is less effective and redundent
