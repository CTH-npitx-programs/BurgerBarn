The first is to go into the form, and find the event they are bound to.
Then, you type a new event. That will create a second event, and all of them are bound to it.
Meanwhile, the original one is no longer bound to anything, but by copying the name of the event, it will now be bound. Then delete the intermediary.

By doing this, you can always see there is a refference, but a forseeable downside is that it will end up somehow containing both events
