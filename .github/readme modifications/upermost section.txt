# Burger Barn
A simple, highly gernalized program for purchaseing burgers
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why
Hmm, what if we make a List of all the Reqrirments!
## Expirments
of course, in the process, some tests are bound to be made, and expirments be documented
the expirments whose documentation survives the mess of code we have here, they will go here too!

# Reqrirments
just the requriments of the program. still needs work, as some of the reqriments seem in-compatabible.
