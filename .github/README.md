# Burger Barn
A simple, highly gernalized program for "purchaseing" burgers
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why?
Hmm, what if we make a ***List of all the Reqrirments!***

# Reqrirments
just the requriments of the program. still needs work, as some of the reqriments seem in-compatabible.
## Useage & simple notes
Create a menu program that allows users to order items off a menu, and presents them with a calculated total when they are done.
Your program must include a flowchart.
