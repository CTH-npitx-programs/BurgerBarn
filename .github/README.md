# Burger Barn
A simple, highly gernalized program for "purchaseing" burgers
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why?
Hmm, what if we make a ***List of all the Reqrirments!***
# Reqrirments/ modification
just the requriments of the program, or the edits to make to said program
## What modification
consolidate the events, so it:
1. the sides are 1 event
2. the drinks are 1 event
3. the burgers are 1 event

or combine them all into 1...

WORKS THE SAME AS BEFORE
