# Burger Barn
A simple, highly gernalized program for "purchaseing" burgers
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why?
Hmm, what if we make a ***List of all the Reqrirments!***
# Reqrirments/ modification

## What modification
1. put all repeating code in a method. You know, like I did in the 1.0...
