# Burger Barn
A simple general burger ordering program
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why?

## Perhaps to list the requirments?

# Reqrirments
## Useage & simple notes
Create a menu program that allows users to order items off a menu, and presents them with a calculated total when they are done.

Your program must include a flowchart.

The program must meet the following requirements:
## Reqrirements
At start, display a one-time welcome message that will not reappear once the screen is cleared.


Selecting a menu item will display a message:
"You purchased [menu item] for [price]"
If the user enters an invalid number, display an error message and ask them to enter the item again.
Clear the screen after each user input
 




Your program must include a flowchart.

The program must meet the following requirements:

Display a menu of food options using Radio Buttons and Labels
Burgers:
Plain burger ($4.99), Cheeseburger ($5.99), Veggie burger ($6.49), Bacon burger ($7.99)
Sides
Fries ($.50), Tater tots ($.75), Onion rings ($.99), Chips ($.99)
Drinks
Cola ($1.29), Tea ($1.19), Fruit punch ($1.09), Water ($.99)
Users can only select one item in each category
Have a List Box that records all items in your current order
Include a Text Box that contains a running total
Total is dynamically calculated as each item is entered
Total must include 8% sales tax
Users must NOT be able to modify/focus the Text Box
Include two Buttons: Purchase and Exit
Clicking Purchase displays a thank you message, then clears all fields
Clicking Exit exits the program
Additional Challenge (Optional):

Sort the items in the List Box alphabetically
Certain collections of menu items constitute a Combo meal, have the program recognize when these items are entered and adjust the price accordingly:
Plain Burger + Fries + Cola = #1 Combo ($5.99)
Cheeseburger + Tea + Onion Rings = #2 Combo ($6.49)
Bacon Burger + Chips + Cola= #3 Combo ($8.99)
When items are combined into a Combo meal, change the list box to display the combo (remove the individual items and replace with the Combo)
