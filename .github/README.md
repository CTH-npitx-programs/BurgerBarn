# Burger Barn
A simple, highly gernalized program for "purchaseing" burgers
does not need a readme
and yet, here we are... so why?
Hmm, what if we make a ***List of all the Reqrirments!***
# Reqrirments/ modification
just the requriments of the program, or the edits to make to said program
## What modification
in your partners code, do not alter the code or comments (except for bug fixes, which you must also comment)
1. Add a new category "Sandwiches" (see Base Info)
2. Add a new button "Apply Coupon" that applies a 20% discount to the total
3. Coupon can only be applied once; disable the button after it is clicked
4. Once coupon is applied, total should always include the discount, even if the user adds more items after
5. Once the user clicks "Purchase," the coupon discount is removed and the button can be clicked again
6. Your code must be commented. Do not alter any of your partner's code or comments. Only add your own.
7. Your comments should be thorough enough that another coder can understand your code's function by only reading the comments.
8. If there are any errors in your or your partner's code, fix them. You must comment what the error was and what you did to fix it.
