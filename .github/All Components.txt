Add a new category "Sandwiches" with the following menu options:
Chicken Sandwich ($3.99)
Turkey Club ($5.49)
Italian Sub ($7.49)
BLT ($3.49)
Add a new button "Apply Coupon" that applies a 20% discount to the total
Coupon can only be applied once; disable the button after it is clicked
Once coupon is applied, total should always include the discount, even if the user adds more items after
Once the user clicks "Purchase," the coupon discount is removed and the button can be clicked again
Your comments should be thorough enough that another coder can understand your code's function by only reading the comments.


Change the "Apply Coupon" button to a "Combo Box."
The combo box should list several different percentages (example: 20%, 40%, 60%).
Selecting an option applies that discount to the Total.
Remove the Sides category from the menu.
Modify the List Box to sort items (from highest to lowest).
Your code must be thoroughly commented, to the point where another Crew member can understand what your program does without looking at the code.
If there are any errors in the program, whether from your code or your partner's, fix them. Add comments stating what the error was, and how you fixed it.
